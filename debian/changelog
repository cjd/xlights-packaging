To not break everyone's setting, I have to continue using this as a "flag" even thought its not really true anymore. (#1186)

  * (Scott H) Changed code to save FSEQ files in the same folder as the .xml Sequence file. When I originally wrote the code I assumed everyone just saved there xml files into the show directory. This was a dumb assumption on my part. When the "Use Seq Folder" checkbox is set, the folder dialog sets the FSEQ directory to the same value as the show directory. To not break everyone's setting, I have to continue using this as a "flag" even thought its not really true anymore. (#1186)

  * (Keith Westley) Remove categories from vendor model dialog that contain no models.
  * (Scott H) Changed code to save FSEQ files in the same folder as the .xml Sequence file. When I originally wrote the code I assumed everyone just saved there xml files into the show directory. This was a dumb assumption on my part. When the "Use Seq Folder" checkbox is set, the folder dialog sets the FSEQ directory to the same value as the show directory. To not break everyone's setting, I have to continue using this as a "flag" even thought its not really true anymore. (#1186)
